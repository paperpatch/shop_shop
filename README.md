## Setup
:floppy_disk:

Uses the following tools in this repository:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - Open-source, declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Itâ€™s maintained by Facebook, and it can be used to develop of single-page applications (SPA).
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
  - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
  - Open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client. Uses apollo-server-express package to integrate GraphQL into Express.js server, and the @apollo/client package to make requests from React front end to the GraphQL API.
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
  - All-in-one dependency that enables connection to a GraphQL API server and execute queries or mutations using their own special form of React Hooks.
- [React Router](https://graphql.org/)
  - Collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with the application, allowing single-page React applications behave more like multi-page applications.
- [concurrently](https://graphql.org/)
  - Runs multiple processes, or servers, from a single command-line interface, rather than opening multiple terminals to start multiple servers. Tracks multiple outputs in one place and will stop all processes if one fails.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
  - Suite of online payment processing APIs that powers commerce for online businesses of all sizes, allowing them to accept and process payments online.
- [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/elements)
  - Stripe's JavaScript library for building payment flows. Uses Stripe Elements, a set of prebuilt, customizable UI components to allow platforms to collect sensitive payment information. Also provides a single interface for Apple Pay, Google Pay, and the Payment Request API.
